    "One important function of HR is to retain talent. High employee attrition in a company can result to financial cost, lower morale, decrease in producvity  and more. Therefore it's imperative for HR to be able to maintain a healthy employee attrition rate. With this, HR wants you to build a model that will predict if an employee will attrite (leave the company) or stay. By having this kind of model in the company, HR would be able to proactively retain talent and have a healthier attrition rate. \n",
